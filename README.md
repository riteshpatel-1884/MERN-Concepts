**Hi, I‚Äôm Ritesh.**
Welcome to this repository where I‚Äôve compiled my comprehensive notes on the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).

These notes are designed to help both beginners and intermediate developers understand and master full-stack web development using MERN. I‚Äôve put significant effort into organizing and simplifying complex concepts, making this one of the most detailed and easy-to-follow MERN Stack resources available online.

### üìò What's Included:

* Core concepts of MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js
* Hands-on examples and code snippets
* Best practices and development tips
* Project structure and folder organization
* Regularly updated with new insights and improvements

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute. If you find these notes helpful, consider giving the repo a ‚≠ê and sharing it with others!
